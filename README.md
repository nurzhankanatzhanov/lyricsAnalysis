## Music Lyrics Analysis

#### This is a Jupyter Notebook where I compared lyrics of two of my favorite music artists using a machine learning library in Python called *scikit-learn*.

I was learning Python and used some natural language processing (NLP) techniques, KMeans clustering in *scikit-learn*, and *gensim*'s Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) algorithm for topic modeling to see how the algorithm would classify the albums of Kanye West and Drake.
